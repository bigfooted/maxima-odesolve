    "The method of undetermined coefficients (symmetry5) is the most successful methods of the paper of Cheb-terrab and Roche. In the paper, the symmetry generators $\\xi$ and $\\eta$ are assumed to be bivariate: $\\xi=a_1x+a_2y+a_3$, $\\eta=b_1x+b_2y+b_3$ and the coefficients $a_1..a_3,b_1..b_3$ are solved using the method of undetermined coefficients. The default in our maxima implementation is a bivariate polynomial of degree 2. For $\\xi$ this means $\\xi=a_1x + a_2y + a_3 + a_4x^2 + a_5xy + a_6y^2$. This means we can solve many more odes with the method of undetermined coefficients than mentioned in the paper. \n"

The factors are complex, and we value real over complex. This is why we ignore the complex factorization and introduce the new variable $z=\\sqrt{y^2+1}$ and we construct a second degree polynomial in $x,y,z$. Note that if the ode had a term of the form $\\sqrt{y^2-1}=\\sqrt{y+1}\\sqrt{y-1}$, we would have introduced 2 new variables $z_1=\\sqrt{y+1}$ and $z_2=\\sqrt{y-1}$.
