    "The symmetry method is a powerful method to solve differential equations by finding invariant transformations (point symmetries) of the ODE. For first order ODEs, there is no closed form algorithm to find a symmetry in general, but there are algorithms for finding symmetries of a certain form. In [1], a very general algorithm is presented that searches for symmetries of the form $[\\xi = F(x),\\eta=P(x)y+Q(x)]$. In [2], an algorithm is presented for finding several simpler symmetries of the form \n",

    "As a performance test, the database of Kamke's first order ODEs was used [5]. In the database are 367 ODEs of first order and first degree. A number of these ODEs are unsolvable because they are too general (50, 55, 56, 74, 79, 82, 202, 219, 250, 269, 331). 178 of the ODEs are of type separable, linear, inverse linear and Bernoulli and therefore considered straightforward to solve. They are not considered in the evaluation of the symmetry method in [2]. These equations, as well as all homogeneous and Ricatti and Abel odes with constant invariants have linear symmetries of the form considered in [1]. Of the 246 ODEs of first order and first degree that are left, 133 were solved by the Cheb-Terrab and Roche method [2].\n",
